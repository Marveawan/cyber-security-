Cyber security definition
Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks.Malware
# Malware-
Malware means malicious software. One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user’s computer. Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment or legitimate-looking download, malware may be used by cybercriminals to make money or in politically motivated cyber-attacks.
# Virus-:
A self-replicating program that attaches itself to clean file and spreads throughout a computer system, infecting files with malicious code.
# Spyware: 
A program that secretly records what a user does, so that cybercriminals can make use of this information. For example, spyware could capture credit card details.
# Phishing
Phishing is when cybercriminals target victims with emails that appear to be from a legitimate company asking for sensitive information. Phishing attacks are often used to dupe people into handing over credit card data and other personal information.

# Man-in-the-middle attack
A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber threat where a cybercriminal intercepts communication between two individuals in order to steal data.
For example, on an unsecure WiFi network, an attacker could intercept data being passed from the victim’s device and the network.
# Distributed denial-of-service 
(DDoS) attacks are those in which multiple systems disrupt the traffic of a targeted system, such as a server, website or other network resource. By flooding the target with messages, connection requests or packets, the attackers can slow the system or crash it, preventing legitimate traffic from using it.
# SQL injection
An SQL (structured language query) injection is a type of cyber-attack used to take control of and steal data from a database. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in data-driven applications to insert malicious code into a databased via a malicious SQL statement. This gives them access to the sensitive information contained in the database.

# CIA triad
Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The model is also sometimes referred to as the AIC triad (availability, integrity and confidentiality) to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. Although elements of the triad are three of the most foundational and crucial cybersecurity needs, experts believe the CIA triad needs an upgrade to stay effective.
## Confidentiality 
Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to privacy. Confidentiality measures are designed to prevent sensitive information from unauthorized access attempts. It is common for data to be categorized according to the amount and type of damage that could be done if it fell into the wrong hands. More or less stringent measures can then be implemented according to those categories.
## Integrity
Integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality).
## Availability
Availability means information should be consistently and readily accessible for authorized parties. This involves properly maintaining hardware and technical infrastructure and systems that hold and display the information
#password attack
it’s a type of cyber attack where hackers attempt to access a file, folder, account, or computer secured with a password.
It’s generally done with the help of software that expedites cracking or guessing passwords. That’s why following a secure practice when creating passwords is vital, like avoiding using your pet’s name, nicknames, apartment address, etc. These go-to passwords are too obvious, easy to guess, and successfully breach—, especially by those who know you personally.
